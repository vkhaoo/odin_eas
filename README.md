TOP Project - Etch a Sketch

This project was fun to make.
Overall, it didn't require too much time, but going through some of the main core logic of javascript, definetely helped me refine and test my skills.
During this project, I kind of struggled when part of my code didn't work: I was trying to statically change the grid, making a function that worked before the effective grid was created. I overcame this issue by adding the function directly when the grid itself was created.

This project helped me to play around with functions, buttons, flexbox and their fundementals.
